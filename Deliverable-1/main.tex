\chapter{Introduction}

There are many types of TVMs available across the globe like Beverage TVM, movie ticket TVM, and transit TVM. The vending machine is defined as a machine that provides a desired service when money/debit/credit cards are inserted. We are going to use Subway (Metro) Ticket vending machine for this project. People In Montreal are using the TVMs provided by the STM(Société de transport de Montréal). Primary tasks of that include recharging the cards provided by the STM and dispensing appropriate tickets/fare passes to users. We have selected this type of TVM because of its flexibility and user interface. It allows users to collect specific types of transit fares based on their requirements. To illustrates, there are many transit fares available like day pass, morning\ evening pass, and weekend pass. Another flexibility of this TVM is its language, it is available in two primary languages in Canada English and French. This TVM accepts fare charges by credit\ debit card or via cash and has good security for transactions and will provide the appropriate receipt to the user. These documents also provide an understanding of iGo. It focuses on the features expressed by stakeholders that they would like to see in the application.\\ [0.1in]

\chapter {Domain Model for iGO}
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=180mm,height=150mm,scale=0.5]{Domain.png}
  \caption{Domain Model for iGO}
\end{figure}

\item A problem domain model is a conceptual representation of the real-world setting in which a software system is meant to function. It describes the entities, concepts, and connections pertinent to the issue the software system is trying to address.
\item At the analysis stage of software development, when the focus is on comprehending the problem that needs to be solved and the specifications for the solution, a problem domain model is often constructed. Depending on the approach being used, the model can have a variety of shapes, but it frequently consists of textual descriptions of the domain ideas and connections together with diagrams, such as entity-relationship diagrams.
\item A problem domain model's goal is to assist software developers in comprehending the industry they are working in and in determining the specifications for the software system. It can also assist in locating future issues and prospects for development in the industry.

\item The iGo System has a domain model that consists of multiple entities and relationships:\\

\item \textbf{Entities:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{iGo System:} The overall systems include the location of the station, language to select from the user, Registered users, and payment.
\item \textbf{User:} User contains the name, email address, home address, and card id.
\item \textbf{iGo Card:} UThis entity contains the id and validity of the card that users have.
\item \textbf{Payment:} This Entity contains the different types of payment methods it accepts and the different ways to generate the receipt.
\end{itemize}


\item \textbf{Relationships:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{iGo System:} contains location and language: The system includes the location of the system and the language that are used by the user to interact with the user.
\item \textbf{Generalization of the user:} User can be categorized as a student, senior citizen, and Regular User.
\item \textbf{User Interact with System:} users interact with the system using a reloading card or by purchasing the tickets.
\item \textbf{Bank accepts the payment:} payment made by the user to purchase the ticket and reload the card is accepted by the Bank and generates either email receipts or physical receipts.
\item \textbf{Generalization of payment method:} User can make payment either from cash, credit card, or debit card.
\end{itemize}

\section{Interviews}
Interviews are the most common way to collect data about any software`s requirements and we can get to know what users actually want in the software based on their previous good or bad experiences.\\
In this project, we have conducted several interviews with not only students but different age groups of people and backgrounds. We have conducted these interviews via different mediums such as google forms, audio, and in-person.\\\\

\section{Sample Interview Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How often do you travel by public transport?
    \item What kind of improvement would you like to bring to in the existing system??
    \item Would you like to have an email receipt of your payments for recharging or purchasing tickets?
    \item What kind of ticket do you usually purchase?
    \item Have you ever encountered a TVM software transaction process that was too lengthy or complex?
    \item Have you encountered any issues in the past where the TVM software was not \item compatible with a payment method that you wanted to use?
    \item Have you ever found the button layout in TVM software confusing or difficult to use?
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusions of Interview}
The following conclusions were obtained based on the interviews:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item All of the interviewees mentioned that they would prefer having an online application instead of using TVM machines as it is more time-saving and convenient.
    \item There have been cases where the TVM does not work as expected or is confusing to use. Having an online application with an improved UI could solve such problems. 
    \item Most interviewees agreed that getting an email receipt is better than a paper receipt as it is easier to manage and track. 
    \item It was also noted that most interviewees suggested having a TVM at places other than metro stations so that it is more accessible and can avoid long waiting times. 
\end{enumerate}
\chapter{Use case model}

\section{Interview-3}
Date – 26-02-2023, 3:30 PM\\
\textbf{Interviewer:} Yash Radadiya\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} Sharad Narola \\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:}How often do you travel by public transport? (Often, rarely, very rarely)?\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} Very\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:}What kind of improvement would you like to bring in the existing system??\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} There are many TVMS available in metro stations, they are efficient for the public but on the peak times especially means on the 1st day of every month it`s not efficient to serve a large number of people as everyone has to recharge their cards. Consequentially there was a long queue in the metro station and people are getting late for their work. So, this is the area where I want improvements.\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:}  Do you want STM to install TVMs to be located other than the metro station?? (Yes / No)\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} Yes I want STM to install TVMs in different parts of the city as at present they are only available in the metro stations so people have to go to the metro station to recharge their cards but imagine that if people are living far from metro stations and they are using bus transit for daily usage than it would be better than TVMs are also available at bus stations.\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:}  Would you like to prefer having online mechanisms for recharging cards?? (Yes / No)\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} Yes it would be great if they will adopt the option of recharging cards online as it will save a lot of time in public and they do not have to be in long queues for recharging their cards.\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:} Would you like to have an email receipt of your payments for recharging or purchasing tickets? (Yes / No)\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} Yes, I would like to have an email receipt rather than a paper-based receipt, as it`s better to keep a record and to handle their expense. Another reason is that email receipts are safe compared to paper receipts, as many people just garbage their receipts and afterward if they need them they can`t able to find them.\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:}  Which method of payment do you prefer? (Card / Cash / Apple-Google Pay)\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} Card\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:} What kind of ticket do you usually purchase? (Daily / Weekly /  Monthly / One way / Two way) \\
\textbf{Interviewee:} I am purchasing a monthly ticket as I am doing a part-time job and don`t have a car so it`s better to have a monthly pass and it is cheap. \\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:} Have you ever found the instructions provided
in TVM unclear or confusing? (Yes / No)\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} No\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:} Have you ever encountered a TVM software transaction process that was too lengthy or complex? (Yes / No)\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} No\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:}  Have you encountered errors while using TVMs before? (Yes / No) If yes, How clear were the error messages and how helpful was the information provided?\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} Yes, the message regarding the error was clear.\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:}  Have you encountered any issues in the past where the TVM software was not compatible with a payment method that you wanted to use? (Yes / No)\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} Yes, once my credit card was not accepted by the machine.\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:}  Have you used TVMs in the past that were slow or unresponsive? (Yes / No)\\
\textbf{Interviewee:} Yes\\\\
\textbf{Interviewer:}  Have you ever encountered a TVM menu that was particularly difficult to navigate? (Yes / No)\\
